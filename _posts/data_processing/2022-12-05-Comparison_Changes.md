<!--## Comparison and Changes between Two Periods-->

In this example the script identifies patients present in one of the two periods and absent in the other, either because the patient was new or was unenrolled. With table and group_by is possible to tally the numbers and associate these with, for example, the practices they were linked to.

### Example Main Results by Groups of Changes.
